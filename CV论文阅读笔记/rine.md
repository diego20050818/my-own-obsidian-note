> > To address the SID task more effectively, we propose the RINE model by leveraging Representations from Intermediate Encoder-blocks of CLIP. Specifically, we collect the image representations provided by intermediate Transformer blocks that carry low-level visual information and project them with learnable linear mappings to a forgery-aware
