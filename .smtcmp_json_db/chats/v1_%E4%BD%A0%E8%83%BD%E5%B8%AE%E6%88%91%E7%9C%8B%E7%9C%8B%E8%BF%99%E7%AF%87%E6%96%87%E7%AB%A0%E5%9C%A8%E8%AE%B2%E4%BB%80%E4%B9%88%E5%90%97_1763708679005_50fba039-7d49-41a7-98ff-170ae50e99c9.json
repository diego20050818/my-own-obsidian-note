In recent years, with the gradual promotion of green energy transformation and low-carbon development in various countries, the dynamics of crude oil market have become more complicated and changeable. The price of crude oil is not only influenced by traditional factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical conflict and production technology, but also faces the challenges of energy policy transformation, carbon emission control and new energy technology development. This diversified driving factor makes the prediction of crude oil price not only very important in economic decision-making and energy planning, but also a key issue in financial markets.In this paper, the spot price data of European Brent crude oil provided by us energy information administration are selected, and a deep learning model with three layers of LSTM units is constructed to predict the crude oil price in the next few days. The results show that the LSTM model performs well in capturing the overall price trend, although there is some deviation during the period of sharp price fluctuation. The research in this paper not only verifies the applicability of LSTM model in energy market forecasting, but also provides data support for policy makers and investors when facing the uncertainty of crude oil price.\",\n    \"published\": \"2024-09-19T00:25:22Z\",\n    \"updated\": \"2024-09-19T00:25:22Z\",\n    \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12376v1\",\n    \"pdfUrl\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12376v1\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"cs.LG\",\n      \"cs.DC\"\n    ],\n    \"primaryCategory\": \"cs.LG\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"1004.3276v1\",\n    \"title\": \"Color Image Compression Based On Wavelet Packet Best Tree\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      \"G.

Recently discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet has emerged as popular techniques for image compression. The wavelet transform is one of the major processing components of image compression. The result of the compression changes as per the basis and tap of the wavelet used. It is proposed that proper selection of mother wavelet on the basis of nature of images, improve the quality as well as compression ratio remarkably. We suggest the novel technique, which is based on wavelet packet best tree based on Threshold Entropy with enhanced run-length encoding. This method reduces the time complexity of wavelet packets decomposition as complete tree is not decomposed. Our algorithm selects the sub-bands, which include significant information based on threshold entropy. The enhanced run length encoding technique is suggested provides better results than RLE.

The results on the benchmark suggest that a dynamic model of 13 lags is the optimal to forecast spot price direction for the short-term. Further, the forecast accuracy of the direction of the market was 78%, 66%, and 53% for one, two, and three days in future conclusively.

Besides supply and demand, crude oil prices are largely influenced by various factors, such as economic development, financial markets, conflicts, wars, and political events. Most previous research treats crude oil price forecasting as a time series or econometric variable prediction problem. Although recently there have been researches considering the effects of real-time news events, most of these works mainly use raw news headlines or topic models to extract text features without profoundly exploring the event information. In this study, a novel crude oil price forecasting framework, AGESL, is proposed to deal with this problem. In our approach, an open domain event extraction algorithm is utilized to extract underlying related events, and a text sentiment analysis algorithm is used to extract sentiment from massive news. Then a deep neural network integrating the news event features, sentimental features, and historical price features is built to predict future crude oil prices. Empirical experiments are performed on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price data, and the results show that our approach obtains superior performance compared with several benchmark methods.\",\n    \"published\": \"2021-11-14T08:48:43Z\",\n    \"updated\": \"2021-11-14T08:48:43Z\",\n    \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09111v1\",\n    \"pdfUrl\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09111v1\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"cs.LG\",\n      \"cs.AI\",\n      \"cs.CL\",\n      \"econ.GN\",\n      \"stat.AP\"\n    ],\n    \"primaryCategory\": \"cs.LG\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"1804.10869v1\",\n    \"title\": \"Application of Probabilistic Graphical Models in Forecasting Crude Oil Price\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      \"Danish A.

We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent probabilistic forecasts for time series when reliable hierarchical information is present. We call it Deep Poisson Mixture Network (DPMN).

We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing the DPMN to other state-of-the-art methods which produce hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasts on multiple public datasets. Comparing to existing coherent probabilistic models, we obtain a relative improvement in the overall Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 11.8% on Australian domestic tourism data, and 8.1% on the Favorita grocery sales dataset, where time series are grouped with geographical hierarchies or travel intent hierarchies.

While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.\",\n    \"published\": \"2024-10-07T18:51:23Z\",\n    \"updated\": \"2025-04-12T17:30:20Z\",\n    \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05431v2\",\n    \"pdfUrl\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05431v2\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"cs.LG\",\n      \"physics.ao-ph\"\n    ],\n    \"primaryCategory\": \"cs.LG\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"2102.05107v1\",\n    \"title\": \"Sub-seasonal forecasting with a large ensemble of deep-learning weather prediction models\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      \"Jonathan A.

This model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a cubed sphere grid to produce global forecasts. The approach is computationally efficient, requiring just three minutes on a single GPU to produce a 320-member set of six-week forecasts at 1.4° resolution. Ensemble spread is primarily produced by randomizing the CNN training process to create a set of 32 DLWP models with slightly different learned weights. Although our DLWP model does not forecast precipitation, it does forecast total column water vapor, and it gives a reasonable 4.5-day deterministic forecast of Hurricane Irma. In addition to simulating mid-latitude weather systems, it spontaneously generates tropical cyclones in a one-year free-running simulation. Averaged globally and over a two-year test set, the ensemble mean RMSE retains skill relative to climatology beyond two-weeks, with anomaly correlation coefficients remaining above 0.6 through six days. Our primary application is to subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting at lead times from two to six weeks. Current forecast systems have low skill in predicting one- or 2-week-average weather patterns at S2S time scales. The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the ranked probability skill score (RPSS) show that the DLWP ensemble is only modestly inferior in performance to the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S ensemble over land at lead times of 4 and 5-6 weeks. At shorter lead times, the ECMWF ensemble performs better than DLWP.\",\n    \"published\": \"2021-02-09T20:14:43Z\",\n    \"updated\": \"2021-02-09T20:14:43Z\",\n    \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05107v1\",\n    \"pdfUrl\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05107v1\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"physics.ao-ph\",\n      \"cs.LG\"\n    ],\n    \"primaryCategory\": \"physics.ao-ph\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"2011.06125v4\",\n    \"title\": \"Hurricane Forecasting: A Novel Multimodal Machine Learning Framework\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      \"Léonard Boussioux\",\n      \"Cynthia Zeng\",\n      \"Théo Guénais\",\n      \"Dimitris Bertsimas\"\n    ],\n    \"abstract\": \"This paper describes a novel machine learning (ML) framework for tropical cyclone intensity and track forecasting, combining multiple ML techniques and utilizing diverse data sources.

In such problems, it is often desired to satisfy the aggregation constraints in a given hierarchy, referred to as hierarchical coherence in the literature. Maintaining coherence while producing accurate forecasts can be a challenging problem, especially in the case of probabilistic forecasting. We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent probabilistic forecasts for time series when reliable hierarchical information is present. We call it Deep Poisson Mixture Network (DPMN). It relies on the combination of neural networks and a statistical model for the joint distribution of the hierarchical multivariate time series structure. By construction, the model guarantees hierarchical coherence and provides simple rules for aggregation and disaggregation of the predictive distributions. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing the DPMN to other state-of-the-art methods which produce hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasts on multiple public datasets. Comparing to existing coherent probabilistic models, we obtain a relative improvement in the overall Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 11.8% on Australian domestic tourism data, and 8.1% on the Favorita grocery sales dataset, where time series are grouped with geographical hierarchies or travel intent hierarchies.

Different turning experiments with varying dynamic behavior of the machine tool structure were performed. We compare the performance of these two methods with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification and Gradient Boosting combined with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We also show that the common WPT-based approach of choosing wavelet packets with the highest energy ratios as representative features for chatter does not always result in packets that enclose the chatter frequency, thus reducing the classification accuracy. Further, we test the transfer learning capability of each of these methods by training the classifier on one of the cutting configurations and then testing it on the other cases. It is found that when training and testing on data from the same cutting configuration both methods yield high accuracies reaching in one of the cases as high as 94% and 95%, respectively, for WPT and EEMD.

We analyze here some of the most important mathematical properties of these risk-dependent centrality measures. In particular, we study the newly observed phenomenon of ranking interlacement, by means of which two entities may interlace their ranking positions in terms of risk in the network as a consequence of the change in the external conditions only, i.e., without any change in the topology. We test the risk-dependent centralities by studying two real-world systems: the network generated by collecting assets of the S\\\\&P 100 and the corporate board network of the US top companies, according to Forbes in 1999.
