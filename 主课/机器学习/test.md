> > Machine learning contains a large number of matrix multiplications. Now we need to calculate the product of three matrices 𝐴𝐴, 𝐵𝐵, 𝐶𝐶. Suppose the dimensions of 𝐴𝐴, 𝐵𝐵, 𝐶𝐶 are 𝑚𝑚 × 𝑛𝑛, 𝑛𝑛 × 𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝 × 𝑞𝑞 respectively, where 𝑚𝑚 < 𝑛𝑛 < 𝑝𝑝 < 𝑞𝑞. Which of the following calculations is correct and also the most efficient. A. (𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵)𝐶𝐶 B. (𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶)𝐵𝐵 C. 𝐴𝐴(𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶) D. 𝐴𝐴(𝐶𝐶𝐵𝐵)
